  I initially wanted to to this project in SwiftUI and Combine, when I was told that it has to support older devices then I've decided to do classic MVVM with @escaping closures and completion handlers. It was fun :-) .I had very limited time last week and app is still not 100% finish but it's fully functional. Second screen uses Diffable Data Source package and methods for that are very different than in the main Event's screen, where I used good old Table View. I still need to move all the logic except UI from controllers mainly the Scedule one, it's almost there. I only done Unit Test for networking part as this is fully finished. Methods in viewModels will change slightly so no test for them yet. I even thought of using Coordinators but that would take me even longer, I only had few spare hours last week as we moving to new place. 
 
 I wish you great day
 Lukasz
